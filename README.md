<h1 align="center">Clyde</h1>
<p align="center">LLM-powered Discord bot</p>

Originally started as a re-creation of Discord's discontinued ClydeAI experiment, but then multimodal support was added for fun, and IDK.

Uses Ollama for LLM inference as it works *fine* for low-VRAM systems.

- `llama3:instruct` for conversation.
- `llava:7b-v1.6-mistral-q4_K_M` for image descriptions.
